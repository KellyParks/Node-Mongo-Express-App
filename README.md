# Star Wars Quotes App: Experimenting with Node, MongoDB and Express

This is a little app to get acquainted with Node, MongoDB and Express. It performs basic CRUD operations on a simple dataset that's stored in MongoDB's Atlas cloud service.

The premise of the app is to store, display, update and delete entries from a collection of famous Star Wars quotes. I followed along with the tutorial created by Zell Liew (https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb).

## Improvement Ideas

Node has an events module that could replace much of the code in public/main.js. A front-end framework, like ReactJS, would be a good addition as well.

## To Run:

Open a bash terminal at the root of the project, and run `node server.js`. Then navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.
